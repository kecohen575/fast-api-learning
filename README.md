## Math API

A concise FastAPI service that evaluates arithmetic expressions. It provides three main endpoints:

- `GET /add?x={x}&y={y}`: Adds two integers.  
- `GET /square/{number}`: Squares a number.  
- `POST /solve`: Solves a general arithmetic expression with optional rounding.

Containerized for local deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.
